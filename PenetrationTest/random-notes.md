# Notes

## InfoSec Triad
* **Confidentiality** means that no unauthorized users may read any data
* **Integrity** means that no unauthorized users can write data
* **Availability** means that the system must be available to authorized users to read and write data.

## Attacks on InfoSec
* An **interruption** attack is an attack on availability.
* An **interception** attack is an attack on confidentiality.
* There are two related kinds of attacks on integrity: **modification** attacks which modify already existing data, and **fabrication** attacks which add additional data to the system.

## Active vs. Passive
* **Active attacks** actually change the system under attack somehow, such as by adding an additional program that runs in the background, changing users passwords, or modifying data stored on the system. 
* **Passive attacks** do not cause any changes to the system.
